# Exercise 6: Trigonometry with Floats

This is an exercise for the coursera course [Introduction to C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-programming-unity)

In the **Main** method, do the following:

1. Prompt for and get an angle in degrees and store it in a **float** variable.  
2. Calculate and display the cosine and sine of the angle.  

Suggested Test Case: If you enter 90 for the angle, the cosine should be approximately 0 and the sine should be approximately 1. These aren't exact because we get a little rounding error (because {2}^{b} = n2 
b=n!)
